# Bierla App V3
## Information:
The newest Bierla App is built using Python and the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) library. As you can see here it is open source software, which means anyone can adapt and use this app as he wishes. I will slowly add all the mandatory to know things to join the developement for this app in this readme file.  
If you are not familiar with the Bierla, we are just a group of friends. For fun I decided to create an application for us. At the moment all the application does is displaying images, statements and birthdays of our friends.  
The aim for this app later on is that it helps managing our group by displaying events and managing polls, but this will still take a lot of time.  
If you like the idea of a friend managing software feel free to join developement. Feel free to open issues and requests if you encounter anything.
## How to use:
If you are just here to use the App, then look no further. Here are the basic instruction to install and use the app.
### 1) Installation
In the [Builds](/Builds) Folder you will find the finished applications that are ready to use. Currently the only prebuild package that are supplied are .apk files for Android.
### 2) App Data
For different reasons I decided that the app uses a dedicated folder on the normally accesible storage of the users device to get its data. I know it is far from perfect but this currently allows for quick manipulation from any user.
I prepaired the folder for our group but will share it with them on another platform to avoid putting personal data here on Github. Lateron I will create an example folder for this repository to see how it works.  
When you launch the app, swipe to the settings tab and press the button to select the path. This will open a file chooser. From here navigate to the location on your device where you saved the prepaired folder. Head into that folder and tap the select button. The App should now load all its data from the folder.
### 3) Adding Data
